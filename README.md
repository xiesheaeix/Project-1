<Concentration Project>
  Concentration is a memory game where all tiles start in a face down position. When 
  a user clicks a tile the front face of the tile is shown. Every tile in the game
  has a matching pair. To win the game, you must match all of the tiles but you only
  10 chances at guessing. My version of this game has a scary twist, there is loud 
  audio and a jump scare involved.
